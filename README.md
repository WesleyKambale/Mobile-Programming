# Mobile-Programming
#Java
I needed an import statement for Arrays in order to be able to use them in printing out the list of courses I do.

#Kotlin
No import statements needed to print out the list of courses that I do.
Fewer lines of code needed to write the program in comparison with Java.

#Running the Programs
Due to restrictions on how many files that can be uploaded to a GitHub repository, I extracted the main files for each project
- Android Manifest files
- Main folders with their files
